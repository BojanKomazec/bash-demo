# bash-demo
A collection of bash shell scripts which demonstrate Bash syntax and common Linux commands and tools.

# Running the script

Make sure `demo.sh` has executable (`x`) permissions for the current user.
To run the script use:
```
./demo.sh
```

All files and directories that are required by the script (which are not created by the script) have to be inside `required` directory.
